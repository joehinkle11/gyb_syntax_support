# gyb_syntax_support

This is a mirror I'm manually supporting (no scripts automatically keep the mirror in sync) pointing at the `gyb_syntax_support` subdirectory in [Apple's Swift repo](https://github.com/apple/swift).

Quick link https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main/utils/gyb_syntax_support

Following [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/)'s format...

| Xcode Release | Swift Release Tag | SwiftSyntax Release Tag  | gyb_syntax_support Release Tag  |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Xcode 12.5   | swift-5.4-RELEASE   | 0.50400.0 | swift-5.4-RELEASE |
| Xcode 12.0   | swift-5.3-RELEASE   | 0.50300.0 | swift-5.3-RELEASE |
| Xcode 11.4   | swift-5.2-RELEASE   | 0.50200.0 | swift-5.2-RELEASE |


Notes: the default branch is `main`

If someone knows how to automate this, that would be nice, but it isn't very critical as I just plan to update with major Swift releases for now.
