# gyb_syntax_support

This is a mirror I'm manually supporting (no scripts automatically keep the mirror in sync) pointing at the `gyb_syntax_support` subdirectory in [Apple's Swift repo](https://github.com/apple/swift).

The point is so be able to quickly get these files for use in my other projects.
 - my a Swift Interpreter (private, maybe I'll open source when complete),
 - [Syntax Stubs](http://github.com/joehinkle11/SwiftSyntaxStubs)
 - Syntax to Stub converter (also private)


Following [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/)'s format...

| Xcode Release | Swift Release Tag | SwiftSyntax Release Tag  | gyb_syntax_support Release Tag  |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Xcode 11.4   | swift-5.2-RELEASE   | 0.50200.0 | swift-5.2-RELEASE |


Notes: the default branch is `main`

If someone knows how to automate this, that would be nice, but it isn't very critical as I just plan to update with major Swift releases for now.
